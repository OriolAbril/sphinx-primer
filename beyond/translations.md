# Translations
Sphinx also supports translations!

ReadTheDocs has a [great guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/manage-translations-sphinx.html)
on managing translations.

This site has been set up to have English (default), Catalan and Spanish versions.
They are managed with Transifex following the steps in the guide.
Thus, translations are collaborative and can be pulled manually to the docs.
If you want to contribute to translating this primer, you can do so on [sphinx-primer-website](https://www.transifex.com/arviz/sphinx-primer-website)
Transifex project.

On the website, translations can be accessed from the version switcher at the bottom right of the page.
Note that the location of this menu depends on the theme.
