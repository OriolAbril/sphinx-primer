# Goals of this primer

The main focus of this resource is to give only a very general overview
of the sphinx related infrastructure used in ArviZ and PyMC, without
explaining much directly.

Here are some things you should or should not expect from this resource:

:::{list-table}
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` learn MyST or rST
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` understand why MyST and rST are important
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` learn which roles and directives exist
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` learn what a role and a directive are
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` configure sphinx builds
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` understand all the terms in this table and in the intro diagram
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` learn how to use the extensions that power ArviZ and PyMC docs
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` learn which extensions are used in ArviZ and PyMC docs and why
:::

Most of the content will be references to other documentation pages
for sphinx, sphinx extensions, the MyST syntax guide...
The value we aim to provide with this resource is double fold though.
To centralize all these external references and links to useful documentation
in a single place and to explain how all these fit together to serve
our documentation goals at ArviZ and PyMC.
