# Goals of this primer

The main focus of this resource is to give only a very general overview
of the sphinx related infrastructure used in ArviZ and PyMC, without
explaining much directly.

Most of the content will be references to other documentation pages
for sphinx, sphinx extensions, the MyST syntax guide...
The value we aim to provide with this resource is double fold though.
To centralize all these external references and links to useful documentation
in a single place and to explain how all these fit together to serve
our documentation goals at ArviZ and PyMC.
