# Goals of this primer

The main focus of this resource is to give only a very general overview
of the sphinx related infrastructure used in ArviZ and PyMC, without
explaining much directly.

Here are some things you should or should not expect from this resource:

:::{list-table}
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` MyST or rST syntax guides
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` explanations on why MyST and rST are important
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` descriptions about which roles and directives exist
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` explanations on what a role and a directive are
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` explanation on how to configure sphinx builds
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` brief explanations on all the terms in this table and in the intro diagram
* - {fas}`times-circle;sd-text-danger` tutorials on how to use the extensions that power ArviZ and PyMC docs
  - {fas}`check-circle;sd-text-success` descriptions about which extensions are used in ArviZ and PyMC docs and why
:::

Most of the content will be references to other documentation pages
for sphinx, sphinx extensions, the MyST syntax guide...
The value of this resource is double fold though.
It centralizes all these external references and links to useful documentation
in a single place and it explains how all these fit together to serve
the documentation goals at ArviZ and PyMC.
