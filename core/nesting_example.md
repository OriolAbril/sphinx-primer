1. We start with a numbered list

   > Within the list we quote a section of some documentation
   >
   > :::{important}
   > The documentation has an info box with some code inside it:
   >
   > ```
   > print("Nested formatting yay!")
   > ```
   > :::

1. We continue the list and markdown knows that it's the same list and not a new one.
