# Themes

Sphinx supports multiple themes so that one can easily change the appearance of
the documentation without changing the content.

Both ArviZ and PyMC use the [pydata sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
which is extremely customizable even via variables in the `conf.py` alone.
