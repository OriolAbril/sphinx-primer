"As you can see, MyST allows two syntaxes to define directives. Both work "
"exactly the same, however, using the colon fence option has the advantage of"
" rendering the main content of the directive as markdown which while only "
"partially right, can already help get an idea of formatting issues. After "
"all, markup without roles and directives in MyST is very similar to pure "
"markdown."

"Also note that in MyST, directives are defined with 3 or more "

"backticks/colons to avoid syntax errors due to anbiguity about which "
